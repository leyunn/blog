## Intro
Recently, I had the opportunity to use Vanilla JS in a project involving the development of a Chrome extension.

Surprisingly, my experience was not as negative as I had initially anticipated. I want to share my experiences regarding the pros and cons about using Vanilla JS, as well as discuss my thoughts on frameworks.

## What is Vanilla JS?
Vanilla JS actually just means plain Javascript without the use of additional libraries or frameworks. 

The term is a joke that got popular in 2012 because of the website: [vanilla-js.com](http://vanilla-js.com/), it was at the time when JQuery is so popular and people have gone too far and use it for everything.

Nowadays we have tons of JS frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Next.js...etc. This term serves as a reminder to developers about the inherent capabilities of JavaScript itself.

## Why did I decide to use it in this project?

Here are the two key reasons why I decided to use plain javascript in this project:

### The project scope
Since the project does not heavily rely on frontend components, and the data flow and UI interactions are relatively straightforward, the efficiency gains provided by frameworks are not that significant.


### The nature of extenion development
Chrome provides built in production ready packaging tools and environment for chrome extensions, so I don't need addtional build tools to handle this, which resolves another issues of using plain JS.

## My experience

During the development process, there are definitely times where I miss the convenience of having a framework. However, overall, I don't have any regrets about my decision.

Here are a few things I want to talk about:

### Structure
One advantage of working in a code environment without any imposed structure is the freedom to architect everything according to my preferences.

Something I learned a lot throughout the experience is the importance of making abstractions and separating different levels of abstraction to ensure readable and maintainable code.

For example, I adopted the practice of encapsulating DOM manipulation within functions, avoiding direct DOM access in other functions:
```javascript
const hide_UI_element = (element_name) =>{
    generation_elements[element_name].style.display = 'none'
}
```
This conectp is something I read in the book called "*Clean Code*" by *Robert Martin*, but I never really have to implement it myself since frameworks typically handle such tasks for me.

### Maintaince
This is probabily the best part, wihtout the need to manage all the dependencies makes life so much easier. Furthermore, the absence of third-party libraries makes it less likely to encountering unexpected issues.

### Limitation
There are definitely limitations when it comes to Vanilla JS project: 
1. Crafting complex features manually can lead to lengthier and harder-to-read code. 
2. If more advanced features or external services are needed, it can be challenging to integrate

## Reflection

### Frameworks vs Vanilla JS?
Whenever any library or framework becomes extremely popular, there will inevitably be voices opposing frameworks or libraries. Vanilla JS can be seen as a response under the context.

Frameworks are great tools, definitely worth to learn and use, it simplifies a lot of complex implementation, so developer can focus on the ideas.

However, sometimes when you are too used to these high abstractions, you become accustomed to following the framework's conventions, which could prevent you from exploring different approaches or thinking creatively.

Moreover, frameworks evolve rapidly, you don't know when the framework you are familar with would become become outdated. Libraries might becomes unsupported over time. 

On the other hand, javascript likely will not die anytime soon. If you have mastered JS, it becomes easier to adapt to new frameworks, since they are built upon its foundation. 

### Conclusion
Consider vanilla JS as an option when creating small projects. It is a good way to review the fundamentals of JavaScript and gain a better understanding of software architecture.
