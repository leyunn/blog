## My thoughts

Yahoo's interview process was different from other international tech companies. Instead of solely testing my coding ability, they evaluated my overall knowledge of software engineering.

I didn't think I had prepared enough on LeetCode to get into a big tech company, but Yahoo's coding questions weren’t too difficult. I did struggle a bit on the 3-sum problem (which I’m a bit embarrassed), but they were really nice and guided me through solving it. I can tell that they care more about how you think and communicate than the actual solution.

I was also a little surprised they asked about system design, considering I’m a new grad with no experience. Usually, that’s not something they ask for junior roles. Luckily, I am very interested in system design and have studied about it during my exchange, so I was able to provide a decent answer.

Overall I am very happy with the offer and I am looking forward to working at Yahoo, I would be documenting my experience there as well.
